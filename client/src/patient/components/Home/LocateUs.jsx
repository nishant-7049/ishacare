          des: `Namskar,
          Myself Neeta Tamrakar, 52, house-wife, delivers my gratitude while writing my review & sharing my progress experience at Isha Wellness Centre, Indore.
          I am a patient of severe arthritis from past 10 years. I have experienced unbearable pain in both my knees all these years & was suggested both knee replacement surgery by well known doctors. My condition was worsened as I was on wheelchair, walking 10-20 steps was almost impossible, climbing stairs was once again a dream like a new born child & even getting in & out of a car were frightening experiences.
          This was the time of 2021 when I & my family were almost helpless about my condition & both knee replacement surgery was the only option we thought we had until we met the founders of ISHA WELLNESS CENTRE, Dr. Hitesh & Dr. Minjan.
          This was the turning point of my life as we decided to postpone (& now cancelled) our plan for surgery & go with the physio-acupressure-yoga-stretching therapy as suggested by both the doctors at Isha wellness centre, Indore.
          The founders are gems individually & in the field of health, mind, body & wellness as well.
          With their team of expertly well trained Facilitators, they (Dr. Hitesh & Dr. Minjan) curated a well effective program of daily therapy sessions for me which included Physiotherapy, acupressure therapy, yoga, stretching & aerobics. Also they made changes in my diet & lifestyle.
          Since one year, I am going for these sessions, daily 2-2.5 hours & I am immensely happy in telling you that the results my body has achieved are MIRACULOUS.
          * I left using my wheelchair after 1.5 months of therapy & haven't used it since then.
          * After 5-6 months of therapy, I was able to walk without walker or any other support.
          * After 10 months of therapy I started to climb stairs.
          * And today, I am able to walk, do all the household chores, attend social gatherings & do everything that I was restricted due to my health condition one year back.
          Nothing, I think would have made me this much healthier, confident & harmonious than Isha wellness centre, Indore, the founders & their expert team.
          Wish I would have met them earlier so I could have enjoyed my son's wedding instead of using a wheelchair back then.
          No words can do justice to the hard work, sincerity, time & energy that the founders & the team of Isha wellness centre has put in me as a patient.
          Everyone at the centre encourages me to overcome this problem & make every possible effort by their expert program for me to do so.
          Apart from relieve in knee joint pain, there are other various good impact on my body that I have achieved with this therapy.
          My energy level, my sleep cycle, my digestion, metabolism, sugar level (as I am diabetic) & mind-body wellness has improved to great levels.
          I would suggest Isha Wellness Centre, Indore to anybody young or old with any problem in the body they may have, surgery suggested patients or just routine pain patients and Isha wellness centre has the solution for all of them.
          At last I would like to thank both the founder doctors & their entire team, Ashwin bhaiya, Ayush Bhaiya & Pooja didi for the second life that I am living because of them. They are truly the people of GOD.
          Hope they grow themselves across the world & spread life, happiness & wellness.`,

I had received therapy from ISHA Wellness Centre, and found therapy session very helpful and effective for me. On the first session, just after few hrs it felt very much relaxed & there was less pain in my back. I am fine with my problem in couple of sessions. They have also guided me so that I can prevent injury and also strengthen my particular muscles in a way so that I can play better.
  
          Now I have started playing again without any pain. Special thanks to the team for helping me fit, Best supporting Doctors and staff! I will recommend to all must visit IWC for any health related issues.`,

          des: `Hello,
          Myself Vedansh Pendrawala, 26, businessman, is immensely happy in writing this review for Isha Wellness Centre, Indore.
          A few days back, I was diagnosed with grade 1 fatty liver. Due to which I suffered severe abdominal pain for a stretch of a month until I visited Isha Wellness Centre.
          It only took them 1 therapy session to wash away that prolonged pain.
          Also I continued the therapy for almost a month.
          There was a mix of therapies, yoga, aerobics & stretching in each session. With this physical exercise part, they also guide us through the diet, sleep cycle & other lifestyle aspects during our tenure.
          They also guided me for some corrections in my professional & personal lifestyle like my driving position, office chair position, sleeping position & a whole lot changes in my diet which resulted in reduction of some types of pains & other problems faced in daily routine.
          Everybody @Isha is dedicated to get away the unhealthy part in you & they put loads of effort to get you through it.
          The founders, Mr. & Mrs. Rajpurohit knows every detail of the body. From the functionalities of it to the minute complexities of it. These guys are true genius.
          Isha Wellness Centre is a true example of what a wellness centre should be. They are doing the work of God!
          I hope to see more upcoming centres like this in all over the world.
          Kudos to these guys!

          After discussing it with mummy I came to know about ISHA WELLNESS CENTER ,with doubts in my mind and anxiety I went there and discussed my problem with DR MINJAN & DR HITESH ,out of suprise I was just amaze by their approach toward my injury and healing process
          Firstly they asked me the reason of my injury ,after knowing the reason they analysed the wrong doings in my workout and explained me about the balance between stamina strength and suppleness.
          
          Secondly the councelled me about the need to know the requirement of the body and pushing myself for what can be considered as benificial toward the health of body and mind
          
          Thirdly the prospectus which any of the physio would do ie to make u do a specific set of exercise and give a type of diet or routine to be followed
          But ....belive me without the first to step it may be possible that the u will recover from Pai but in order for a complete hollistic healing from the injury the first two steps are nessecary which are forte of this place
          I will suggest any patient having any sort of injury to atleast go and meet the team for once
          I assure u won't regret
          From my side it is a complete 5 star rating for centre😇`,
